# Machine Learning Regression

Machine learning regression is a technique used to analyze the relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (outcome). It is primarily applied in predictive modeling, where the goal is to predict continuous outcomes. This involves training models on labeled data to understand how features influence the outcome, which allows the model to predict future or missing data.

## Key Points:
- **Purpose**: Predict continuous outcomes and understand relationships between variables.
- **Applications**: Forecasting and decision-making in industries like finance, healthcare, and retail.
- **Examples of Tasks**: Predicting house prices, stock trends, sales figures, etc.
## Types of Regression:
### 1. Simple Linear Regression
- Models the relationship between a single independent variable and the dependent variable.
- Uses a straight line for prediction.

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
- Involves more than one independent variable to model the relationship with the dependent variable.
- Provides a better fit compared to simple linear regression.

### 3. Logistic Regression
- Used for binary outcomes (e.g., success or failure).
- Predicts the probability of a dependent variable using a sigmoid curve.

# Example :
##  Linear Regression :

```bash
$ python Predictive-Analytics-and-Data-Exploration-Projects/linear_gift.ipynb
